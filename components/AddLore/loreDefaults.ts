_Delete below guide to write your own_

This where you can write your lore.... You can see how it will appear in the book in the preview panel.

# Images
You can add images via links, OR, upload from your computer using the toolbar.

### Image uploads

Use the toolbar image icon to upload an image to IPFS. Once uploaded (to IPFS) they also appear as a link, like so:

![wizards-2140-2-back.png](ipfs://QmNSLAeDX346AjSCVUrbD1YCBYRJz4hH3RLUVbAmx67VNz)

### External Image Links

To add image (or anything else) as a link, you can do it via the toolbar link icon. First write some text for the name of your link, then [highlight](https://www.forgottenrunes.com) it and press the link icon.

### Embedded videos

If you put in a YouTube link (no special syntax) on its own then it shows it embedded, see below:

# Tagging other characters

You can tag other wizards, souls etc in any normal text (so not a heading or a link). Here are some examples:

Best wizard of all is @wizard2140. His dreams of befriending @pony0 one day. Watch out for @soul1732!
