# Dev on the Book of Lore

Running The Book of Lore locally is involved. The pieces are:

- An Ethereum chain (Ganache, Rinkeby, etc.)
- The [`ForgottenRunesWizardCult.sol` minting contract](https://github.com/forgottenrunes/forgotten-runes-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ForgottenRunesWizardsCult.sol) deployed and configured
- Your account minting and/or holding `ForgottenRunesWizardCult` ERC721s
- The [`BookOfLore.sol` contract](https://github.com/forgottenrunes/forgotten-runes-contracts/blob/master/contracts/BookOfLore.sol) deployed and configured
- A [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/quick-start) local development node

## Docs for Graph Protocol

- [graph-node/getting-started.md](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
- [graph-node/docker](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/tree/master/docker)
- [graphprotocol/graph-node: Graph Node indexes data from blockchains such as Ethereum and serves it over GraphQL](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node)

## Docker vs. Running Locally

In theory, running with `docker-compose` should be easier, but I found it's easier to just manually install all of the parts. ymmv.

## Postgres

```
createdb graphprotocol
createuser frwc
psql graphprotocol

# in the psql shell
grant all privileges on database graphprotocol to frwc;
alter user frwc with superuser;
```

## Commands

Start the Graph Protocol Node

```
cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \
        --postgres-url postgresql://frwc:@localhost:5432/graphprotocol \
        --ethereum-rpc rinkeby:https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/mykeyhere \
        --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001 \
        --debug
```

Deploy the local subgraph

```
cd bookoflore-subgraph
yarn
yarn codegen
yarn build
yarn create-local
yarn deploy-local
```

## URLs

GraphiQL: http://localhost:8000/
HTTP: http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>
WebSockets: ws://localhost:8001/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>

## Running On Rinkeby

## Flow

### Adding Lore

`/lore/write`

On submit, the form hits: `/api/lore` and then uses `pages/lore/wait-for-lore-tx.tsx` to wait for the tx

`/api/lore` - `pages/api/lore.tsx`

## Environment Variables

- `SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT`
- `PINATA_SECRET_KEY`
- `PINATA_ID`
